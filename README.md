# Age-in-Days-Minutes-Seconds Demo
A software that helps users to calculate their age in days, minutes and seconds.
A very simple age estimation calculator based on Kotlin language. The reason that I created this app mainly to review the knowledge of Kotlin and to get familiar with Android Studio.

Note that I use the principle that a year is 365 days to estimate the age, so when the user's age is 366 days for a year, the estimation will be inaccurate.
